    <h1>
      Emoji as a new way of communication. The influence of media.
    </h1>


    <p>
      In 1995, one of the greatest inventions of our time was created: the Internet, it led to the widespread use of the network using Internet browsers. The Internet, of course, not only brought visible benefits to its consumers but also significantly changed their lives and communication with each other. Using the Internet to send messages preceded the invention of Internet browsers, which means that communication has had more time to be influenced by information technology (NELSON, 2006).
    </p>

    <p>
      The online community provides a wide range of opportunities: a large amount of information, quick and easy communication, online trading, watching movies, access to music, radio, online games and much more. Nevertheless, the Internet does have disadvantages. One of them is the lack of emotions via online communication. In real life, we have visual contact with a person by which we see the facial expressions, gestures and intonations (Jandl et al., 2017). The digital world wide web has progressed so rapidly over the past few years that there was a need to find a solution to compensate for missing communication aspects needed not to misunderstand the interlocutor. The enormous amount of information we started to receive with the Internet invention made us find the solution for spending less time on each piece of information. We need to send and read the message properly as quickly as possible. The emergence of a new texting language connected to the immediacy and compactness of these new communication media came with the popularity and rise in the use of online text-based communications (Lucchi, 2015).
    </p>

    <p>
<y>Punctuation</y> was one of the apparent solutions to express emphatic intonation of the speaker. Marks of exclamation and interrogation make the text emotional and expressive. Emotional pauses are shown with the dash. Moreover, suspension marks can be assumed as a disappointment, hesitation, embarrassment. Another way of punctuation use is it independently as the whole sentence. For example, a question mark in the conversation can work on its own as the complete question. This approach also proves our intention to reduce the time we spend on writing each message. Still, the range of tools is limited.
    </p>

    <p>
<y>Initialisms</y>  from the Internet slang is another way to show your emotion in a quick way via message. Initialisms are abbreviations which consist of the first letters of words. You achieve the speed of delivering the mood of your message, and it takes less time for the sender to create it. Still, while the slang shortcuts save time for the writer, they take two times as long for the reader to understand.
    </p>

    <p>
Thus the <y>ASCII art</y> was created. ASCII art is a form of visual art using ASCII characters on a monitor or printer screen to represent images. American Standard Code for Information Interchange - American Standard Code Table for printed characters and some special codes. With the development of social networks, the art of drawing with symbols is gaining popularity around the world, since drawing with symbols is a great way to express your emotions and mood by making explicit pictures from symbols. There are some advantages such as small size, universality since any computer displays ASCII art graphics regardless of graphic editors and people of any nationality understand the images. However, it is rather time-consuming to make those type of pictures (Nettime, 1999).
    </p>

    <p>
<y>Emoticons</y> are what takes not as much time as ASCII art still they intended to convey your feelings. Emoticon - a pictogram depicting an emotion created from different typographic characters. Nevertheless, users are limited by the existing set of characters.
    </p>

    <p>
To increase the range of icons, the <y>emoji</y> was created. Unlike emoticons, emoji is a finished image with a particular meaning. The first emoji appeared on Japanese mobile phones in the late 90s. The inventor of emoji was the 25-year-old Shigetaka Kurita. He developed emoticons while working at NTT DoCoMo, a Japanese telecommunications company. In all, he drew 176 emoji sized 12 × 12 pixels, indicating people, places and objects (Pardes, 2018). As planned by Kurita, it was a set of characters that conveyed the full range of human emotions. Emoji quickly became popular in Japan. Mobile application research continued to develop throughout the 2000s, companies outside Japan, such as Apple, saw the possibility of using emoji on other platforms. In 2007 Google internationalisation team decided to lead this idea by requesting recognition of the Unicode Consortium emoji, a nonprofit group that works like the United Nations to support text standards on computers. In 2011 Apple launched its operating system with Kurita's symbols included. Emoji became so widely used all over the world that it needed to develop further, and in 2015 extensive repertory of pictures were added such as skin tones, for example.
    </p>

    <p>
All ranges of social life adapt to fast technology development with the use of emoji. Even <y>White House</y> Council of Economic Advisors released a report about the status of Millennials across the nation, touching on education, debt, and healthcare rates. The rise of emoji language occurred at the time of millennials and widely used by them, so it makes sense to communicate with this generation using their language. The fact that such a big and powerful institution as White House used emoji as a tool to attract youngers shows the influence of these Kurita's symbols. I suppose it was done because of several reasons. Firstly, in order to simplify the perception of the materials for better understanding of the younger generation. Secondly, to make it more familiar visually to how this generation is used to communicate. Thirdly, to decrease the distance between the government and the public. Moreover, the fact that from 2015 emoji characters were added and developed according to cultural and political issues shows that politicians do understand the effect these symbols have on society. To sum up, technology progress makes influence not only to day-to-day communication but also on how the government accepts and adapts to the fast-moving digital field.
    </p>

    <p>
The effective use of emoji can be noticed in marketing campaigns as well. The success, recognition and universality of this 'new language' had started to spread through all levels of society. The Cannes Lions 2015 Titanium Jury awarded <y>Domino</y> with the top prize. In 2015, Domino chose to utilise emojis to give more comfort to clients who need to order pizza. The Domino account lets clients choose their preferred pizza, and the connection with their Twitter account allows the client to send tweets to Domino with a pizza sign. It works as a preferred pizza immediate delivery. The Domino model is fascinating. It shows us the alternative use of emojis other than narrating (Siyang, 2018).
    </p>

    <p>
Not only Domino used Kurita's invention to communicate with the public. The world's biggest condom brand <y>Durex</y> used emoji for the package redesign and created a series of promotion videos. The campaign is based on research that most people talk about sex in messengers using the language of emojis. In the video, the brand uses Kurita's symbols system is the solution to overcome embarrassment. In this campaign, we see that emojis is a new way to help you overcome restraint and talk about your thoughts in a new way.
    </p>

    <p>
The indisputable success of Emojis pushed an International brand <y>IKEA</y> to create its own keyboard based on Kurita's symbols. They are improving communication at home with IKEA Emoticons. People have discovered trouble continuously in correspondence. In the home circumstance, mistaken assumptions happen most around the mess. What's more, that is the reason IKEA presents Emojis: a specialised system to guarantee all-inclusive love and comprehension in your home. All hints, desires and questions will be understood right away. It is an excellent example of the implementation of a new marketing strategy that involves icons as a medium to communicate digitally (IKEA, 2015).
    </p>

    <p>
Emoji can even be a tool to entertain potential customers in social media. For instance, the Russian chain of alcohol supermarkets <y>Red&White</y> on their official Twitter page played with alcohol and glass emojis when creating posts (Санечек, 2019). The target audience is millennials, who are the twitter users. So the success of this visual language of entertainment shows the significance of emoji and its influence.

    </p>

    <p>
The UX/UI <y>Instagram</y> development is a proof of the society’s need for a quick way of corresponding. In the middle of 2018, Instagram started testing emoji response option for Instagram Stories, which would give Stories viewers another way to engage with posts (Hutchinson, 2018). The use of emojis in an International biggest social media app shows us the universality of emojis. Moreover, it shows the need of a tool for quick reactions for nowadays users. The fact that it's the begging of 2020 and Instagram is still offering us this type of response demonstrates its success. Furthermore, the title of this function 'quick response' describes the purpose of emojis itself.
    </p>

    <p>
<y>'Deadpool'</y> movie promotion campaign was based on emoji. The emoji-fied banner used the (dead/poo/L) icons to convey the title of the film (McCarthy, 2016). I assume that it was made to attract people as it is a new visual language uncommon for billboards and movie advertising. Moreover, the target audience will immediately read the message behind the images as they are familiar with the signs. Furthermore, this design reflects the movie's tongue-in-cheek humour, without seeming like overkill.
    </p>

    <p>
There is a tendency to digitalising the world in general and communication in particular. That provoked us to find the solution to compensate for the lack of visual contact we have when communicating online. Emoji plays the role of a universal language as ancient drawings used to be at those times, but nowadays, it has a different function. Its purpose is to simplify, add emotions. Moreover, Kurita's language speeds up the reading and writing with the help of the message behind the icon. Even one emoji at the end of the sentence can completely change the meaning of the whole message. And that's not the only use which Kurita's language has. Since the beginning of time, humanity has been using symbols for communication, from the time of cave paintings to codified systems. People used ideograms and pictograms, which were then transformed into letters and symbols. And now humanity is returning to the original idea of using images instead of text. That's the power of a small icon.
    </p>

    <p>
The Internet develops very fast and influences our lives a lot. It has brought into our lives many advantages and possibilities as well as some limitations and new problems. Obviously, its impact is noticed worldwide on all the levels of life. Digitalising tends us to adapt to it,  to develop new ways of communication and even changes our way of thinking. We invent new ways of delivering information in order to compensate for the disadvantages modern technologies have. Those limitations lead us to search for new ways of working upon society. Emoji is the latest invention that is used worldwide. Even though it has been invented not long ago, the influence and power it has today cannot be underestimated. Its impact and significance allows me to call emoji- the new language.
