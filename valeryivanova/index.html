<h1>Mimicry</h1>

<body>

<p>In the animal world, mimicry is very common - small animals to improve their resilience unconsciously acquire the external qualities of their more formidable neighbours. They do not get fangs, poison, sharp teeth - no, they get combat colouring on their wings, bright stripes on the sides, painted eyes of predators (Encylopaedia, 2020). Mimicry is a colouring that makes the owner look like something else. A method or result of hiding an animal, human or equipment from the enemy, giving the impression that they are part of the natural environment (ResearchGate, 2019). Detailed study of each colour separately and its relationship with other colours, shades and perception of colours by the human eye, ways of masking animals in the natural environment and lessons of evolution - everything that was written and sketched by the American artist Abbott Thayer in "Concealing Coloration in Animal Kingdom", formed the basis of the theory of mimicry (Springler, 2019). Defining disguise from a natural point of view: Hide your true nature. According to Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection, features such as camouflage have evolved to provide individual animals with a reproductive advantage, allowing them to leave more offspring than other species on average (Biologywise, 2019).</p>


 <p>Art is the same process of endless mimicry - the shimmering of meanings and garments, the transfer of the centre of gravity from the outer to the inner and vice versa, attempts to smuggle new meanings and new themes in someone else's clothing. Pseudo-pictures are cleverly forged under the real - the art of mimicry is brought to perfection (Behance, 2020). Everything is filled with believable and professionally drawn motifs. Professionals are passionate about life imitating forms. Everything that breathes, grows, wriggles or grows is suitable for copying the design. Today, designers can easily come up with a fabric in the form of intertwined blood arteries, print chairs, as if grown from the vertebrae, or a decor reminiscent of the surrounding world. Mimicry is a kind of mask that hides the true essence or intent of a person or object, the desire to be invisible to divert the attention of another person or, conversely, to draw his attention to something positive, or something seemingly positive (Energy&Environment, 2017).</p>

<p>Camouflage is an example of a mimicry in which the imitator copies the natural background. Colour palette, pattern or visual illusion designed to make the owner fit into the landscape and almost invisible to others is a camouflage (Explorable, 2008). The most common type of camouflage is crypsis, because the colours of the objects resemble their surroundings. The military took the principle of animals hiding using natural camouflage idea and began to actively create and use their own types of camouflage. This print was invented by the military to protect their army and make it as discreet as possible in the field. In both world wars, the artists were recruited as camouflage officers. The art of camouflage is akin to a visual deception, who, more than artists, was destined to become its founders. Military camouflage patterns have been popular in human world since 1915 (HistoryExtra, 2016).</p>

<p>As a rule masking is understood as reducing the contrast visibility of the object in the optical range in order to make it difficult to identify the object. A lot of known camouflages can be easily made so that one highly visible object will appear to be two, two objects - three and so on. The military recognised the use of camouflage only during the First World War (Samantha Kavky, 2016).  Around the same time, it began to appear not only on the uniform of soldiers, but also on military equipment. In 1917, the marinist and illustrator Norman Wilkinson and the vorticist Edward Wadsworth solved the problem of "invisibility" simply: they decided to defragment the silhouette of the ship with the help of colouring. One of the most unusual types of camouflage was called "Deforming pattern». For this purpose, a crazy and killer for the eye drawing was developed - a Dazzle camouflage (FURFUR, 2019). The deforming camouflage designed by Norman Wilkinson did not try to hide the whole ship, but only distorted its shape. Meanwhile Norman based his method on the newly emerging style of fine art - cubism. The officer and gentleman easily realised that the volume characteristic of cubist paintings can confuse enemy gunmen. One should note here that nowadays, technology has put an end to this type of camouflage. Or rather, its military use: optical devices could not be cheated in this way. On the other hand, Dazzle immediately picked up the post-war generation - this type of camouflage is still relevant and often used in creation of youth clothing lines (VoxMedia, 2020).</p>



<p>It is well-known fact that nowadays camouflage is also widespread among the civilian population, it is worn not only by hunters or military. The style of clothing "military" is popular among people of different professions. On the streets of the city we can meet a man in a business suit and with an army watch on his arm, a woman walking with her child in a spotted park, young people playing outdoor sports in comfortable army pants. "Army" things bribe with their convenience and durability, they don't have a good view of the dirt on them, and they "stretch" the figure well, allowing them to look tighter (HistoryExtra, 2016). The British clothing brand Maharishi, based in London, is a company that supports respect for nature. The collections use natural fibres and organic cotton fabrics. Military style is a constant attribute of Maharishi's eco-friendly utilitarian clothing. The British designer, who in the very early 90s, even before his career in the world of big fashion and the launch of the brand Maharishi, began to explore the history of camouflage almost from a scientific point of view. He has dedicated more than 20 years to camouflage and has long perceived it not as an ordinary pattern but as a complex visual structure. Blachmann's point of view, the military uniform is directly based on natural mimicry, monotonous pattern and variety of cut. The Bonsai Forest Camo, for example, is based on an organic subtext. Thus, at the beginning of the new century at one point coincided fashion, military world and painting (Grailed,2019). ‘A lot of people like the idea of wearing clothes that make them invisible, as Dutch artist Desiree Palmen says. In addition, for many years, Hardy has been working with constructions of classic militaristic silhouettes. What is more,  Hardy released the encyclopaedia of camouflage "DPM: Disruptive Pattern Material" - a weighty two-volume book, in one part of which he told about the phenomenon of camouflage and militaristic aesthetics in the art world, and in the other part - collected data on camouflage of almost all military countries, including the post-Soviet space (Guardian, 2020).</p>





<p>It is noticeable that camouflage models have appeared in the works of artists with anti-war messages. Many major artists and designers used style and camouflage symbols in their works, and military clothing or camouflage imitations were used as a symbol of political protest. One of them is Liu Bolin, an artist from China, has learned to adapt perfectly to any environment, completely blending  with the surrounding environment on his photos. Bolin creates his works using the technique of "creative camouflage». It takes up to ten hours to create each work - as a result, passers-by often overlook the author until he moves. This series of works was made by Liu in protest against the Chinese authorities who closed his studio in Beijing and pursued not only him but many other contemporary Chinese artists (Liu Bolin, 2020). His photos address the question of the social status of art as a whole. In his work, the artist hides to recover and protect himself. It focuses on the individual's inability to fit into society, while showing how the human environment invisibly and invisibly penetrates and becomes an integral part of it. Including himself in a certain landscape allows Liu Bolin to protest against the political climate or social situation, while maintaining a certain degree of anonymity. He also reflects on environmental and global warming issues in his work (Atlantic, 2019).</p>



 <p>Disguise is needed for different purposes, so it has many different shapes and manifestations depending on the type and task. And what is the best disguise, perhaps the one that turns out to be the most effective. After all, the main task of any disguise - to mislead the enemy. Everything that is invented and invented by man has long existed and invented by nature. And man only draws from it ideas for the invention of a new, which is actually "old as the world". And so with disguise. Since ancient times, animals have been endowed with nature's ability to mimicry. That is, to merge and become indistinguishable in different conditions of the world around them, landscape, situation. By studying the nature the people already artificially apply mimicry in social life (HistoryExtra, 2016).</p>


<p>‘Mimicry tries to regress to a world before the separation between nature and culture, the signifier and the signified, the subject and the object. The desire to play with spectres results in a becoming spectre. The subject leaves behind all individuality and becomes one with the world. Mimicry wants to take the shape, colour, and the structure of nature. And it wants to do this through cultural products. Mimicry erases the boundary between life and literature and even when there is no head, there is the subject automatically doing what it has to do.’ (Cengiz Erdem, 2011)</p>


<p>Doubtless, every moment of time we go through these stages - absorb, infiltrate, mimicry (NCBI, 2019).  It's possible to deny, it's possible to accept this state. Some take it as a disease of society, some take it as progress.  As moss grows on a tree, as a network grows in our hands and eyes, as well as information flows in our heads, constantly absorb, infiltrate, mimicry. There are more and more problems in the world and these problems provoke people to try to hide and become invisible to those who try to harm. Humanity creates endless problems that oppress their lives while trying to hide from them. It seems that literally everyone in nature can mimic - except for a people who look like a stranger in any natural landscape. But we're part of nature, too. Camouflage in the human world continues to progress and evolve. For everyone, it has its own meaning and purpose. To draw the conclusion, one can say that constant pressure of the crowd, mass thinking, oppressive duties and many other factors that destroy the individuality of a person lead to the fact that more and more often we want to "disappear from the radar screens", to dissolve at least for a while in the beauty of nature, to fall out of the busy daily schedule, to become invisible person (Psychology, 2020).</p>
