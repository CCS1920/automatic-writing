      <h1> Makeup. Traditional and untraditional approaches. <h1>
        <body>
         <p>Makeup had been and is the most popular beauty tool. With time its purpose and concepts have changed. There was and still traditional understanding of it. But modern concepts and approaches of makeup have emerged.</p>
            <h3> Makeup Origins </h3>
           <p>Perhaps the Ancient East can be considered the birthplace of cosmetics and make-up. Both men and women were painted, and the idea of how to decorate the face and body of different peoples was specific. Egyptian women very actively cared about the appearance: coal-instead of a pencil for eyebrows, the blood of black bulls – as a dark hair dye, nail polish, lipstick, substance for whitening teeth from minerals with plants, crushed bones and teeth of animals, etc. Make-up was also used for medical purposes: the Egyptians believed that by applying eyeliner, they prevent eye rot and inflammation of the eyelids from dryness and hot blinding sun.</p>
          <h3>What is makeup?</h3>
          <p>Cosmetics in today's understanding is a means product that changes the appearance. Mostly common concepts of makeup are to embrace beauty or feminity by applying cosmetic products on your face. Nowadays people using makeup mostly to embrace different features. There are a lot of products that have a specific purpose on a different part of a face. Within each product has the visuall characteristic of texture, colour, pigment end etc. </p>
          <p>The main interpretation of makeup is to make yourself different. Back in a time makeup use to become more feminine and ladylike. Fashion and makeup are connected as well as trends change it. Now makeup is a form of expressing yourself. People became to use makeup despite gender or age. </p>
          <h3>Makeup industry and the traditional notion of beauty.</h3>
          <p>What is beauty? The Oxford dictionary defines it as: "A combination of qualities, such as shape, colour, or form, that pleases the aesthetic senses, especially the sight". Beauty. So what is beauty? Is it determined by your age, race, weight Or perhaps it's determined by what you see in the media culture or by popular trends. Peoples views may differ about what beauty is. But there are is still the general population that has similar beliefs about it. (Garuba-Okelarin, S. 2016)</p>
          <h3>Industry Impact</h3>
          <p>Most people believe that would make them ''beautiful' are wardrobe, cosmetic, and surgery. There exist numerous aspects of beauty that are perceived to be classic and timeless.  For instance, if someone is thin, has blond hair and blue eyes they are commonly viewed as a  pretty. For decades people treat those features as beautiful and many women were aspired to look like this. Modern pop culture still portrays these traits and many people still want to look alike.</p>
          <p>What is considered beautiful are continually being reminded to women. A huge number of ads provide an idealized image to all different women. Society has built impossible standards of beauty by showing photoshopped models in ads which violated women's perceptions of themselves.</p>
          <p>The results of many studies that have been done show the negative effect of media on women's self-image. Less research focuses on cosmetic production and how it affects customer self-esteem. There is no doubt that the cosmetics industry affects consumers because millions of dollars a year are spent on cosmetics(Greenfield, S. 2018). </p>
          <p> Nowadays beauty standards have changed along with body positivity movement became popular. All of insecurities women have been an offer to change or hide by the pressure of the beauty industry, now people tend to show that no matter what you look like you're beautiful.</p>
           <h3>Beauty without borders: Why in makeup there are no more rules</h3>
           <p>The world has made significant progress in realizing that beauty standards are a Convention invented by the industry and picked up by society, and everyone should set the rules for themselves and on their own</p>
           <p>Twenty years have passed and the concept of "good taste" about beauty has become much vaguer. Fashion and beauty are now dictated not so much by glossy magazines as by the street, blogs, and popular live people with their idea of beauty. What until recently was an indisputable rule: a clear lip contour, no more than one accent on the face, a neat eyeliner, becomes just an option, but not an indisputable rule. Glitter and sequins used to be used only on "holidays" and moved to "sprinkle more thickly", including the roots of hair and beard. Now better is not less but better is as you want.</p>
           <p>Over the years, a whole generation of cosmetic brands has grown up that proclaim makeup as a means of self-expression, rather than hiding flaws or a way to seduce. Perfect advertising images with photoshopped smooth women have been replaced by images as diverse as life itself and beauty, and make-up bloggers do not stop at what cosmetics offer them, and enthusiastically master plastic makeup. Good and bad makeup no longer exists — and even though every season we try to highlight some specific, most relevant trends, now we need to try very hard to avoid accidentally getting into any of them. Beauty standards that strictly regulate the appearance of women are a thing of the past.</p>
           <h3>Digital Makeup</h3>
           <p>Masks in Instagram replacing makeup. At the base of the mask filters is AR (Augmented Reality) technology, augmented reality, which has spread to all possible segments over the past couple of years. AR plays an important role in the beauty industry: there is now an active growth of applications based on AR and mirrors. For example, thanks to smart mirrors ModiFace, you can try on a shade of lipstick, a new haircut or hair colour. Such innovations only increase sales, and sales are now for generation Z, most of which are visual people.</p>

          <p>Ines Alpha makes fine art pieces using  Snapchat and Instagram filters. She also does collaborations with fashion directors, artists and models to create what she called  “make-up of the future”. In her work, she plays with augmented reality (AR) and often heightens the makeup that people already wear in real life( Behrmann, A. 2020). </p>
          <p>Alpha is against the idea that people should look a certain way and in her filters she allowing people to experience different kinds of beauty. She hopes that her work encourages people to have a more open-minded perspective. For her, the idea of digital makeup on the streets is hard to imagine, but she believes that because people spend a lot of time with their digital second self, AR makeup seems as real and serious as the Internet.</p>
           <h3>Gender</h3>
           <p>Nowadays numerous brands are recognising a gender fluidity in cosmetics is a need. This is a historical fact that makeup was not gender-related.</p>
           <p>The use of eyeliner and other cosmetics was a sign of wealth in ancient Egypt, usually, men put them on to show their status to passers-by and strangers. Recently in history, community people have More recently, makeup was used by members of the LGBTQ+  community as a symbol of femininity, as they could not do without it. Makeup today is becoming back gender-fluid and for the most part, inspired by trends from the past, how it used by LGBTQ+ community back in the time.</p>
           <p>There is more man that buys beauty products and makeup and it is showing that makeup is being used as a form of creative expression and identity. Numerous famous beauty influencers use makeup as an instrument of self-expression, and not as a connection with something feminine. According to a 2017 study, gender is a person's idea of his identity. When it comes to makeup and cosmetics as part of this presentation, the stereotype that they are female attributes turns into a means of expressing gender identity (CHEMBERRY TEAM 2019).</p>

             <figcaption> Instagram - <i> @mannymua733 </i>.</figcaption>
           <figure>
           <p>There are thousands of social media resources that talk about different ways how to apply makeup and creating new looks,  generation z and millennials consumers are in the largest and most various cosmetics market nowadays. Such brands like Estee Lauder and  Laura Mercier aimed at more adult categories of consumers that direct on heightening natural beauty, brands like Colorpop, Milk and Jeffree Star aimed at the young market. In particular, a market that appreciates diversity, vibrant colour schemes, and unusual makeup looks that rebel heteronormative gender identity. </p>
           <h3>Drag Makeup </h3>
           <p>Drag Queen makeup, perhaps, like no other allows you to express yourself and even make a new one. The anatomy of a man's face is different from that of a woman, and since all "Queens" have a goal to appear as a woman (as they imagine it), there are similarities in their makeup. For example, almost every drag Queen makes exaggerated contouring today, although photographer Linda Simpson recalls that in the '90s there was no fashion for it, and the heroines tried to give the face a natural-looking relief. (CLAIR, S. 2013) But regardless of the degree of intensity of contouring, drag Queens always do it according to the female scheme, which differs significantly from the male one in that other parts of the face are darkened.</p>
           <figure>
             <img src="images/aq.jpg" alt="" width "5%">
             <figcaption> Instagram - <i> @ageofaquaria </i>.</figcaption>
           <figure>
           <p>Drag Queen makeup is more of greasepaint. At first, artists are forced to do it themselves, so that a novice artist may have uneven eyeliner and a poorly shaded tone, but this does not confuse anyone. Over time, drag Queens also get their hands on the smokey eye and glue false eyelashes in seconds. They, oddly enough, can look for ideas for everyday makeup — more than drag Queen, no one uses cosmetics, so that their faces can be considered as illustrated manuals. Drag Queens don't make fun of women, as it may seem at first glance. Their main goal is to blur the boundaries between "male" and "female". Dressing up every night in glittering dresses, using eyelashes and nails, Queens show an indecent gesture to a system in which only two genders are correct. And give hope to accept themselves to all who have not yet succeeded.</p>
           <p>Drag in the modern sense is not only a man who turns into a girl.Getting rid of the external signs of gender also works in the opposite direction: women who explore their "male" traits become "drag kings" and gather at their balls, where they wear costumes, moustaches, and even fake penises, parody celebrities, and look for their "inner macho". There are also drag Queen women, no less liberated and luxurious than their biological male counterparts, and alien Queens who look not like women or men, but like living works of art.</p>

             <figure>
           <p>And drag Queen influenced the world of beauty, giving at least three methods of makeup, which are now in use among makeup artists, beauty bloggers, and ordinary users. Such as contouring to correct the face relief, baking to extend the durability of cosmetics and make the skin relief smoother, Ombre on the lips that would simulate volume.
           <h3>Conclusion</h3>
           <p>The sum-up world is changing and with it the concepts of beauty change. Restrictions that we are used to imposing on our appearance are rapidly disappearing into the past, fashion promotes them, and society is becoming softer. Numerous movements and new technologies day after day allow us to see and experiment with our appearance as never before.
