      HIDDEN INFLUENCE OF MEDIA AND PROPAGANDA ON COLLECTIVE MIND.
    </h1>

    <p>
      Currently, the media space has a huge impact on the lives of not only individuals, but also on the life of humanity as a whole. Modern media has the ability to influence our views and beliefs; it is able to educate us, give us moral guidance, impose idols, correct behavior and in the end, they are able to change our worldview, or at worst, build it from scratch. In other words, media influence is the actual force exerted by a media message that leads to a change or deepening of individual audience beliefs.
    </p>

    <p>Indeed, it is difficult to overestimate how much the media influences the formation of personal and public opinion. Generation after generation, humanity has been shaping or transforming its views, opinions and tastes, following the voices of television, radio, Newspapers, the Internet and other forms of media. It is noteworthy that people who are influenced by the media, which are almost all civilized people, are very rarely able to check every single multimedia message, but they can easily believe in many of them, even if it is about events, people, places or ideas that they have never previously encountered.</p>

    <p>The impact of media on human consciousness can be positive, can be negative and can be catastrophic. For example, in the nineties on the territory of Russian Federation was created the largest in the history of the country financial pyramid "MMM", working on the principle of money fraud, in which payments to the first depositors were provided at the expense of funds received from subsequent participants of the pyramid. Accordingly, such a scheme can not function for a long time and the repayment of obligations to the last depositors is obviously impossible. However, due to the active and high-quality work of the media at that time, people did not notice the evidence of deception. A series of commercials were broadcasted on television, the main character of most of which was a simple working guy Lenya Golubkov, who very quickly became a favourite for the masses of the population. The videos were deliberately simple and visual, showing scenes of everyday life of an ordinary person. The popularity of the firm grew rapidly.

      ,<p> The number of depositors of the company has continuously increased and at the time of the collapse was according to various sources from 10 to 15 million people. This means that more than ten million people have suffered in many ways thanks to the work of the media.
    </p>

    <h2>Another story where people was influenced by media this is when one man made the unconscious masses work on the campaign.</h2>

    <p> It was Edward Bernays, whom contemporaries called the "father of public relations" in the 1920s, who made today's world the way we know it - the world of consumption.

<p>Thanks to him, the owners of American corporations learned how to make people dream about things that they do not need at all, deftly connect mass production of goods with unconscious desires and fears, create a person’s illusion of happiness, prosperity and self-confidence through the purchase of certain goods. Thus, Bernays solved the main task - to make people buy more and more goods, to become literally dependent on them, so that without them they would feel uncomfortable.
He achieved the most impressive effect by “teaching” women to smoke (a cigarette in the hands of our girls is precisely his “achievement”).</p>


<p> During and after World War II, tobacco smoking was ubiquitous among men. It was believed that smoking tobacco helped relieve stress. Although the Ministry of Health has attempted to bring public awareness of the dangers of smoking, they have been unsuccessful. Also, smoking at that time had a "gender" - it was an important part of the masculine image.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a woman could not smoke, especially in public - it was almost the same as undressing in the middle of the street. But it so happened that one of the first customers of Bernays was George Hill, president of the famous American tobacco corporation Lucky Strike, who asked him to find a way to destroy this taboo, because he had long understood that he was losing half of his market in the face of women.</p>
<p>“Change culture, change society” - such a task faced Edward Bernays when he was invited to collaborate with the American Tobacco Company on this large-scale project. Bernays skillfully took advantage of the current social situation: by the 30s of the last century, women's rights in the United States had been expanded, but still not enough to talk about equality. The voices of feminists such as Ruth Gale sounded louder.</p>
<p> Large feminist marches often attracted the attention of the general public in large cities. For one of these, Edward Bernays hired several beautiful and slender women to conduct a covert promotion. Women had to walk on a march with lit Lucky Strike cigarettes in their hands - symbols of freedom and independence. </p>

<P> The action worked perfectly: the next day the newspapers were full of headlines of the corresponding content. And it’s hard to overestimate the impact this PR move had on the minds of millions of young girls across America.
It is curious that advertising campaigns hit from two sides at once: they placed on the desire of women for independence and equality, and at the same time emphasized the inherent desire of all women to look good and like men.

<p> So, a more than successful concept was developed that convinced the public of the benefits of smoking. Smoking was attributed to such "side effects" as losing weight and maintaining the body of a woman in good shape. And smoking was skillfully presented as a beautiful and elitist habit of European women from high society. Indeed, in Europe, smoking was not condemned by women.

<p> As a result, Bernays's advertising campaign was a huge success both in the short and long term. According to the American Medical Women's Association, for 42 years - from 1923 to 1965, the percentage of women consuming cigarettes increased from 5% to 33.3% of the total. Do not underestimate the profits of tobacco companies from such large-scale changes in the culture and public consciousness of American society. </p>

    <p> Thus, it is easy to see how the influence of media on the consciousness of mankind in General and on the consciousness of individuals in particular is progressing. If in the nineties the fraudulent organization "MMM" for the sake of achieving its goals focused on the mass stereotypical consciousness and using television was able to achieve the desired without any difficulties, then in 2016 the supporters of Brexit use targeting and almost an individual approach to each potentially useful person who is able to become subject to media influence. It's all like an endless game. People are progressing along with the modern media space for them. What they fell for today will not be able to cloud their consciousness tomorrow, which means that the media space needs to invent new methods of influence every time. Each time more plausible and each time more sophisticated. It's scary.
    </p>

    <P> However, everything that exists in this world is capable of improvement. As mentioned above, the influence of the media is not always carries a very negative character. The media is capable not only of propaganda, but also of education; it is able not only to deceive but also to save from deception. The future of the media space is exclusively in our hands, because we and only we are its creators and feeders. We create what interests us, we are interested in what interests us, and we are influenced only by what interests us. Media influence has long been associated with exceptional positivity. It remains only for humanity itself to be ready for this.
