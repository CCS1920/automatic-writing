    <h1>
      INFLUENCE OF MEDIA ON COLLECTIVE MIND
      AND ON THE MIND OF
      SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS.
    </h1>

    <p>
      Currently, the media space has a huge impact on the lives of not only individuals, but also on the life of humanity as a whole. Modern media has the ability to influence our views and beliefs; it is able to educate us, give us moral guidance<sup> <a href="#item-1">1</a> </sup>, impose idols, correct behavior and, in the end, they are able to change our worldview, or, at worst, build it from scratch. In other words, media influence is the actual force exerted by a media message that leads to a change or deepening of individual audience beliefs.

    <p>Indeed, it is difficult to overestimate how much the media influences the formation of personal and public opinion. Generation after generation, humanity has been shaping or transforming its views, opinions and tastes, following the voices of television, radio, Newspapers, the Internet and other forms of media. It is <b>noteworthy</b> that <i>people</i> who are <sup>influenced</sup> by the media, which are almost all <sub>civilized</sub> people, are very rarely able to check every single <u>multimedia</u> message, but they can easily believe in many of them, even if it is about events, people, places or ideas that they have never previously encountered.</p>

    <p>The impact of media on human consciousness can be positive, can be negative and can be catastrophic. For example, in the nineties on the territiry of Russian Federation was created the largest in the history of the country financial pyramid "MMM", working on the principle of money fraud, in which payments to the first depositors were provided at the expense of funds received from subsequent participants of the pyramid. Accordingly, such a scheme can not function for a long time and the repayment of obligations to the last depositors is obviously impossible. However, due to the active and high-quality work of the media at that time, people did not notice the evidence of deception. A series of commercials were broadcasted on television, the main character of most of which was a simple working guy Lenya Golubkov, who very quickly became a favourite for the masses of the population. The videos were deliberately simple and visual, showing scenes of everyday life of an ordinary person. The popularity of the firm grew rapidly. The number of depositors of the company has continuously increased and at the time of the collapse was according to various sources from 10 to 15 million people. This means that more than ten million people have suffered in many ways thanks to the work of the media.</p>

    <h2>Another story where people was influenced by media</h2>

    If you really want to, with the help of advertising in the tape of social networks, you can not only return the former partner, but also force to vote for leaving the EU. We took a look at the TED talk by English journalist Carol Cadwalladr, in which she described how Facebook influenced the UK referendum.
    Carol Cadwalladr was born and raised in South Wales. Shortly after the announcement of the results of the referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union, she went to her home town of Ebbw Vale to find out why the region had the highest percentage of votes for Brexit.

    Thanks to the EU, the Ebbu Vale railway was upgraded, new College buildings and a sports centre were built. But when asked by a journalist why it is worth leaving the European Union, the locals replied that it had done nothing for the people. In addition, the Welsh expressed dissatisfaction with the migration policy, although in their region there are fewer foreigners.
    One last thing: the pollsters wanted political control back in their hands. And when you consider that the left and right forces have about the same amount of power in Wales, the situation becomes quite strange. Carol Cadwalladr continued to talk to one of the women interviewed. She said that on Facebook she constantly came across all sorts of ads about problems with immigrants. Especially Turkey. They wrote about the country's desire to join the EU, although nothing like this was ever actually mentioned or discussed. The journalist's attempts to find the materials were in vain: there is no archive of advertising on Facebook.

    In the end, according to Carol, the referendum was held "in the dark." And the only person who can shed light on the origin of this ad — mark Zuckerberg-stubbornly refuses to talk.
    Since the XIX century in England there are restrictions on the budget of the advertising campaign. This was to prevent candidates from buying votes. Thanks to the case with Facebook in Wales, it can be said that this law no longer works. You can spend any amount of money on Google, YouTube, and Facebook ads without anyone knowing.  So did the organization Vote Leave, which, according to the journalist, paid for advertising. And the money was obtained illegally. Eventually the posts about Turkey were obtained from Facebook with the help of the British Parliament. And it's not just a story about over budget. This happened to be the biggest election Scam in Britain in a hundred years. Cambridge Analytica’s former employee told about the illegal collection of information, its analysis and drawing up a political portrait of the audience to target advertising during the referendum. Today anonymity can cost the world democracy and fair elections.

    Thus, it is easy to see how the influence of media on the consciousness of mankind in General and on the consciousness of individuals in particular is progressing. If in the nineties the fraudulent organization "MMM" for the sake of achieving its goals focused on the mass stereotypical consciousness and using television was able to achieve the desired without any difficulties, then in 2016 the supporters of Brexit use targeting and almost an individual approach to each potentially useful person who is able to become subject to media influence. It's all like an endless game. People are progressing along with the modern media space for them. What they fell for today will not be able to cloud their consciousness tomorrow, which means that the media space needs to invent new methods of influence every time. Each time more plausible and each time more sophisticated. It's scary.

    However, everything that exists in this world is capable of improvement. As mentioned above, the influence of the media is not always carries a very negative character. The media is capable not only of propaganda, but also of education; it is able not only to deceive but also to save from deception. The future of the media space is exclusively in our hands, because we and only we are its creators and feeders. We create what interests us, we are interested in what interests us, and we are influenced only by what interests us. Media influence has long been associated with exceptional positivity. It remains only for humanity itself to be ready for this.
