Automatic writing is the process or product of writing without using the conscious mind. The technique is often practiced while the person writing is in a trance state; others are fully awake, alert, and aware of their surroundings, but not of the actions of their writing hand. Automatic writing has been predominantly used in Spiritualism or the New Age movement as a method of "channeling" spirits, and has often been a part of s√©ances. During the Surrealist movement, automatic writing was one of many games played by artists to stimulate creativity and produce original works of art. Automatic writing has also been used as a therapeutic technique in Freudian psychoanalysis. Although many skeptics question the source of writings produced in this way, it is clear that many writers have produced material that they would not have written using only their conscious mind. As humankind advances in understanding both the conscious and unconscious aspects of the human mind, and the nature of the afterlife, automatic writing will be better able to make a positive contribution to enhancing the world.
