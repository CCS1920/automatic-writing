    <p>Toy serves as an education part of a child. As a matter of fact, preschool children in need of diversity toys that challenge them to use their minds, bodies and feelings. When a child plays with a toy, it positively effects on the cognitive, emotional and physical development of a kid. (who said that?) For a child it symbolizes the world in a realistic or stylized way, the universe which surrounds them, motivates their activity, living and acting. During a play the children apply toys which determine the type, manner and richness of their playing activities.Thus, a child grows and develops. He needs special toys for harmonious formation. What are these toys? Educational toys are the toys that teach something. They evolve imagination, memory, fantasy, logic and thinking and motor skills. Hence, the toys contribute to the mental and creative growth for a baby. Bruno Munari was an Italian artist and tutor who had been designing educational toys and books. He’s one of the most pioneering and ingenious thinkers of the 20th century, who deeply explores the area of visual narration in children’s literature. (where did you read about bruno munari and his impact?)</p>

    <p>By the artist opinion books had to motivate to think creatively. The books like The Elephant's Wish. Zoo 1963, In the dark of the night. (Nella notte buia)1961,The circus in the mist 1969 which visually demonstrate it. For instance, in the book "Zoo" the author highlights his evident observations about the animals such as: Some camels are more bumpy than others. Something similar say kids when they go to the zoo. Children are more sharp-eyed than adults. (who said that?) Also, Bruno Munari <sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> created the cards that are called Visual Games. They consist of 72 cards, with 48 transparent ones that can be superimposed to compose complex images and stimulate a child’s creativity. A child can overlap pictures of trees, this way he creates a wood. By adding some rain, the sun or the moon, or some birds, a passing dog, or whatever he wants. The child is able of changing the sequence of his story which consists of various images. Moreover, the designer invented Montessori Mobile-Black and White Baby Mobile which helps in the development of a new born.</p>
