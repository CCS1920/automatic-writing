    <h3>subsection 1</h3>
    <p>For my research I’m going to focus on childhood, toy and play.
”One of the luckiest things that can happen to you in life is, I think, to have a happy childhood" that what thinks Agatha Christie. "Childhood is another
country but also a waiting-room, a state of accommodation and acceptance"
said Antoine de Saint-Exupérybecause and I completely agree with his
statement. That’s a fact that all grownups used to be children. It’s true that
childhood was different for everyone but it had a big impact on their entire
lives. Moreover, childhood is a time of various questions, opportunities and
consequences.In the world of childhood reign their laws, their own rules and
down space. Kids completely differ from adults. They have a different height,
children do not have such physical strength and mental skills. Often adults
forget, what is like to be a child.

    <h3>subsection 2</h3>
    <p>In order grown ups could feel themselves as a full member of the society.
Children have to live in a world of beauty, play, music. Pablo Picasso states
that "every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we
grow up. For solving this issue it is important to allow a child to play enough in his childhood. Play is a sparkle that lights up a flame in inquisitiveness mind and curiosity. A dutch psychologist and culturologist Johan Huizinga writes in the book Homo Ludens about the main role of play. He puts the deep
meaning in the concept of play. The culturologist believes that without any
game components can exist neither one kind of a human’s cultural activity
such as: justice, war, philosophy, art and so forth. The culture itself appeared
from play, Johan Huizinga considers that labor didn’t originated a human but
instead the leisure time did it. During that time a person could implement
his fantasies, develop imagination, create artistic values, communicate with
others this definition of play gives the psychologist. Play it is an activity which do willingly in specific place and time. The play is necessarily based on the rules. It is accompanied by tension and thrill. The essence of play implies
games that relate to intelligence, dexterity with the use of wit and strength. He considers that the play itself is tend not only to people but animals too. Johan play is an exercise on the threshold of a serious, adult life.</p>

    <h2>section 2</h2>

    <p>Toy serves as an education part of a child. As a matter of fact, preschool children in need of diversity toys that challenge them to use their minds, bodies and feelings. When a child plays with a toy, it positively effects on the cognitive, emotional and physical development of a kid. (who said that?) For a child it symbolizes the world in a realistic or stylized way, the universe which surrounds them, motivates their activity, living and acting. During a play the children apply toys which determine the type, manner and richness of their playing activities.Thus, a child grows and develops. He needs special toys for harmonious formation. What are these toys? Educational toys are the toys that teach something. They evolve imagination, memory, fantasy, logic and thinking and motor skills. Hence, the toys contribute to the mental and creative growth for a baby. Bruno Munari was an Italian artist and tutor who had been designing educational toys and books. He’s one of the most pioneering and ingenious thinkers of the 20th century, who deeply explores the area of visual narration in children’s literature. (where did you read about bruno munari and his impact?)</p>

    <p>By the artist opinion books had to motivate to think creatively. The books like The Elephant's Wish. Zoo 1963, In the dark of the night. (Nella notte buia)1961,The circus in the mist 1969 which visually demonstrate it. For instance, in the book "Zoo" the author highlights his evident observations about the animals such as: Some camels are more bumpy than others. Something similar say kids when they go to the zoo. Children are more sharp-eyed than adults. (who said that?) Also, Bruno Munari <sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> created the cards that are called Visual Games. They consist of 72 cards, with 48 transparent ones that can be superimposed to compose complex images and stimulate a child’s creativity. A child can overlap pictures of trees, this way he creates a wood. By adding some rain, the sun or the moon, or some birds, a passing dog, or whatever he wants. The child is able of changing the sequence of his story which consists of various images. Moreover, the designer invented Montessori Mobile-Black and White Baby Mobile which helps in the development of a new born.</p>
