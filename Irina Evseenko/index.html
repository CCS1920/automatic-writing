      'Form follows function' => 'Form improves function'
    </header>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      'Form follows function' as the defining principle of the graphic design through the years and minds. Exploration of the 'form' as a core element that helps increase functionality. 'Form' = 'Function' situations.
 
      <h1>Background and context</h1>

      <p>Origin of this statement, the atmosphere where the graphic design was born and developed in the context of this statement and all the regarding changes. Functionality was a defining element as it divided design from art into a separate profession. Modernists as pioneers of graphic design saw practical reason in focusing mainly on functionality when choosing the right form for what they were working on.</p>

      <p>The American architect Louis Sullivan is an author of this famous maxim, which became a modernist’s credo during the 20th century. In 1896, he coined that phrase in an article titled The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered, though he later attributed the core idea to the Roman architect, engineer, and author Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, who wrote that any building must be solid, useful and beautiful. Sullivan actually wrote "form ever follows function", but the simpler and less emphatic phrase is more widely remembered. For Sullivan, this was distilled wisdom, an aesthetic credo, the single "rule that shall permit of no exception". Sullivan developed the shape of the tall steel skyscraper in late 19th-century Chicago at a moment in which technology, taste and economic forces converged and made it necessary to break with established styles. If the shape of the building was not going to be chosen out of the old pattern book, something had to determine form, and according to Sullivan, it was going to be the purpose of the building. Thus, "form follows function", as opposed to "form follows precedent”.</p>

      <p>However, Sullivan himself did not always follow his own directives - certainly not to the same extent as the modernists, who took what he said for dogma. Indeed, while his buildings could be spare and crisp in their principal masses, he often punctuated their plain surfaces with eruptions of lush art nouveau and celtic revival decorations, usually cast in iron or terracotta, and ranging from organic forms like vines and ivy, to more geometric designs, and interlace, inspired by his Irish design heritage. Probably the most famous example is the writhing green ironwork that covers the entrance canopies of the Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building in Chicago. So, it is richly decorated with completely non-functional elements. Thus, Sullivan's credo was brought to life by modernists more than by himself.</p>

      <p>The Austrian architect Adolf Loos worked in the United States at the beginning of his career and admired the functionality of American architecture and the work of Sullivan in particular. In 1908 he wrote an allegorical essay titled "Ornament and Crime" in reaction to the elaborate ornament used by the Vienna Secession architects. He despised the aesthetic theft that many 19th-century creators chose as their strategy. He believed that new times require new means of expression. The machine age has begun, so to use in any kind of design the elements of past eras - nothing more than a farce, a parody, said Loos. "Each era has its own style - why can't it be ours?" He also considered the lack of ornaments "a sign of intellectual power."</p>

      <p>Thus, future modernists adopted Sullivan's maxim as well as Loos's moralistic argument and continued with that when a function is optimized, the form following it automatically becomes perfect. But what is surprising, when in the 20th century the functionality and economy guided the architects and designers in their works, this did not prevent the contrariety between the goal and the result. Many projects created at this time were unsuccessful. Cheap housing, boring cards with safety rules for planes - only a few people wanted to live in these "functional" houses and look at these cards.</p>

      <p>Jan Tschichold, a German typographer, book designer, and educator, played a significant role in the development of graphic design in the 20th century – first, by developing and promoting principles of typographic modernism, and subsequently (and ironically) idealizing conservative typographic structures. His foray to Modernism, and then his return to Classicism highlighted his constant exploration into the ‘proper’ use and application of type, grids, and overall design. Many design schools still teach from his Die Neue Typographiee, despite Tschichold’s own renunciation of it and his later insistence that Modernism has become a “default” style, bereft of human wit and innovation and its typography "is the exemplar of a most inflexible typography which makes no distinction between the advertising of an artistic performance or of a screw catalog. Nor does this typography allow for the human desire for variety. It has an entirely militaristic attitude.” Grids are easy and comfortable, he posited; you don’t have to be especially inventive to make a grid-based design work. This notion was seconded by the beauty-loving Modernist Max Bill, who, in 1949, declared that 'beauty has to be set on the same level as functional demand, since it is a function, too.’</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>The sum-up of the idea that form has much more to offer than just to follow the initial function. The problem of 'sameness' as well as when 'simple' becomes 'boring'. Functionality was a defining element as it divided design from art into a separate profession. But the design process doesn't stop when this functionality is achieved as in this way of designing can hardly progress and develop as a profession.</p>
