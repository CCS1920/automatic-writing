    'Form follows function' => 'Form improves function'
      Introduction
 
    'Form follows function' as the defining principle of the graphic design through the years and minds. Exploration of the 'form' as a core element that helps increase functionality. 'Form' = 'Function' situations.
 
    Background and context
 
    Origin of this statement, the atmosphere where the graphic design was born and developed in the context of this statement and all the regarding changes. Functionality was a defining element as it divided design from art into a separate profession. Modernists as pioneers of graphic design saw practical reason in focusing mainly on functionality when choosing the right form for what they were working on. But later even Jan Tschichold, whose famous Die Neue Typographiee spoused the ultimate Modern ideals, later backtracked and “renounced Modernism as inherently authoritarian and fascist.” Many design schools still teach from this book, despite Tschichold’s own renunciation of it and his later insistence that Modernism has become a “default” style, bereft of human wit and innovation. Grids are easy and comfortable, he posited; you don’t have to be especially inventive to make a grid-based design work. This notion was seconded by the beauty-loving Modernist Max Bill, who, in 1949, declared that 'beauty has to be set on the same level as functional demand, since it is a function, too.’

    Example 1
 
    Multidisciplinary examples when aiming for the pure functionality lead to the opposite effect mainly because 'form' exploration ended just when 'functionality' was achieved.
 
    Example 2

    Examples when further 'form' development leads to a better or even to new unexpected functionality.
 
    Analysis
 
    Analysis of Form/Function relations based on the abovementioned examples. The problem of 'sameness' as well as when 'simple' becomes 'boring'. (Maybe add my personal experience as one more example) Functionality was a defining element as it divided design from art into a separate profession. But the design process doesn't stop when this functionality is achieved as in this way of designing can hardly progress and develop as a profession.
 
    Conclusion
 
    The sum-up of the idea that form has much more to offer than just to follow the initial function.
