    <h1>Graphic Design in Digital Capitalist Society: Problems and Possible Solutions</h1>
    <h2>The Essay</h2>
    <h3>I. Introduction</h3>
    <p>In his 'In the Flow' Boris Groys suggests that the supreme objective of humanity was always, from the very beginning of civilisation, the search of totality. Totality as universality, thereby a way out of particularity, the only possibility to stop being just a part and become a whole. (Groys, 2018)</p>
    <p>Traditionally the role of immortalising unifier of society was a competence of religion and church. By the end of the XIX century, industrial revolution rendered humanity even more powerful than any gods our predecessors could imagine. The rise of computer era and the internet in particular was one of the most promising ways to consolidate civilisation and build a free society. However, by 2020, many media critics, such as Geert Lovink, agreed that eventually the internet turned into an ugly dystopian capitalism-driven machine that produces precarity and creative underclass. One of the specialities affected mostly was graphic design. (Lovink, 2019)</p>
    <h3>II. Background & Context</h3>
    <p>Devaluation of an image — Slow movement as an opposition; how can we rework its principles and rules to apply to design? — Production matters are being dictated by consumption; fast consumption assumes fast production; there cannot be new production methods without reestablishing consumption habits. Are there ways to do so before trying to change current overproductive state of society? — Who wins from overproduction and overconsumption? Capitalist economy that was brought to digital dimension — Design future in other economic systems. Paul Mason's theory on future applied to design and media?</p>
    <h3>Safe ways to practice design today</h3>
    <p>Designer either experiences emotional burnout or changes her notion of how design should be made — What kind of design can and should be created in a world of extremely fast consumption? — Intentionally bad or Vernacular and naive — Bad design — Lebedev's 'express design' as an ironic reaction to growing speed demand — Vernacular as a protest or coping mechanism to produce more, better and faster — Is 'good' and elaborative design even needed? Should we shift the approach towards fast and clumsy designs? — Anton Schnaider's philosophy on 'brutalist' (as he puts it) design</p>
