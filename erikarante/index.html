    <h3>Long-lived Design Extinction</h3>
    <p>Is it possible to create big concepts in a world of today? — Death of metanarrative in approach to design — Micronarrative as a coping mechanism of design: create local, short-lived, specific, instead of big, universal, long-lived</p>
    <p><i>Maybe my need to untangle the situation around dying Big Design is being dictated by modernist idealisation of Pure and Universal? And maybe design shouldn't live long at all? Or, at least, not because we were once told that metanarrative is absolute good (just as anything Big and Stable).</i></p>
    <p>Devaluation of an image — Slow movement as an opposition; how can we rework its principles and rules to apply to design? — Production matters are being dictated by consumption; fast consumption assumes fast production; there cannot be new production methods without reestablishing consumption habits. Are there ways to do so before trying to change current overproductive state of society? — Who wins from overproduction and overconsumption? Capitalist economy that was brought to digital dimension — Design future in other economic systems. Paul Mason's theory on future applied to design and media?</p>
