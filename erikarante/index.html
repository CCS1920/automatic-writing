    <h1>Design and Speed: Alternative Design Practices within Accelerated Capitalist Society</h1>
    <p>In his 'In the Flow' Boris Groys suggests that the supreme objective of humanity was always, from the very beginning of civilisation, the search of totality. Totality as universality, thereby a way out of particularity, the only possibility to stop being just a part and become a whole. To acquire immortality through overcoming finiteness state of secular, temporary being. This search was reflected in almost every religion, from primitive belief in spirits of the dead to Christianity with its promised afterlife that justified suffering in return of endless serenity in heaven. The mesmerising power of art, be it sculpture, painting, or photography, Groys assumes, is the opportunity it gives one to pull anything out of vita activa and contemplate it throughout centuries. Art doesn't cease the flow, but allows to leave it, providing one with a substitute of immortality.</p>
    <p>But what happens when the immortality is being achieved? Moreover, what happens if everyone becomes immortal? How the infrastructure of society alters when every bit of information is being preserved, and each moment of passed history stays within the upcoming future? If art and image in general is a way to get the moment or a person out of the flow, then what happens to the 'factories of immortality' — people who produce content — in the era of total, universal immortality?</p>
    <p>Yuval Noah Harari in 'A Brief History of Human Kind' states the evolution of civilisation may be described in three general steps. The first one is a dialogue between human and nature within primitive society of hunters-gatherers that depended completely on uncontrollable natural forces. The second emerged with agricultural revolution that lead to the emergence of nuclear families, personal property, patriarchic structure of community, and, most importantly, monotheistic notion of God. This era is characterised by the dialogue between human and God and the rise of Church as a transmitter. The transition to industrial society suddenly granted a human being the powers only gods possessed before, and one day, as Nietzsche proclaimed, the God was found dead. Here comes the third and the last step — humanity left alone in the immense universe, clinging to technology and machines.</p>
    <p>In XX century the never-ending pursuit of immortality for the first time stopped operating within the field of immaterial and transcendental. Instead, the machines were employed to continue this search.</p>
    <p>In the first part of her essay 'On Photography' Susan Sontag analyses how photography had established in the modern world, from applied technology, inferior to painting, to the new voice of truth. Things were simple in the beginning: if an event or a person is worth framing, then the photograph automatically acquires meaning, as it depicts something valuable on its own. This principle came to being paradoxically inverted in a few decades since photography began to proliferate around the globe. Instead of reflecting the existing values of the real world, photography started to shape and dictate them. In "Happiness Machines" (2002) Adam Curtis gives an ominous example: in the early 1920s Edward Bernays used a photograph of smoking suffragettes on a protest march to promote cigarettes among women. And if before female smoking was broadly criticised and prejudged, after spreading this photo, tobacco became a new trend and emancipation symbol.</p>
    <p>At the same time, while granting a feeling of specialty to any framed object, photography, as Sontag puts it, also allows the event (or a person) to become in a way immortal. People get old and die, decades pass, but the image stays unchanged, outliving the world it was once born in. The aspiration to keep the beloved ones invincible to time, to highlight the importance of living, to immortalise dear things motivates the popularisation of photography, until it becomes unprecedentedly widespread hobby. Every second millions of photographs are produced. At some point, Sontag continues, the initial meaning gets lost. Another paradox — when the value turns into a massive trend, it inflates to the extent of devaluation.</p>
    <p>In the 1880s, the process of creating a photograph was extremely difficult and was only accessible by a small number of people, primarily technicians and chemists. 100 years after, producing a photograph was almost as easy as today, though people were using film instead of digital media. Photography was demystified on early stages of its existence with the development of technology. The same was about to happen to almost every profession related to the making of visual content with the introduction of a personal computer in the late 1980s. One of those, impacted the first and the most, was graphic design.</p>
    <p>Traditionally being a field that separates conceptual part from production due to the complexity of technical processes, graphic design required dozens of specialities within itself. But with the emergence of desktop publishing, suddenly a huge range of production artists, from typesetters and colour separators to printers and photomechanical technicians, became outdated all at once. One ultimate tool replaced thousands of people.</p>
    <p>Andrew Blauvelt in 'Tools, or Post-production for The Graphic Designer' writes that graphic design tools of the past were bearing a gatekeeping function, which was eliminated with an open access to digital instruments. In a long term, this easiness did not only demystified design practice, but increased general awareness of the activity as such, leading to the growth of interest towards design. More designers began to appear, including self-taught, as the border between being a newbie and a professional started to erode. In the first decade after the rise of computer era, the competition within a field of graphic design went up, while wages went down, the craft experienced a decline, and the market became flooded with amateur work.</p>
