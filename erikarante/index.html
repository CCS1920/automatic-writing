    <h1>Design and Speed: Alternative Design Practices within Accelerated Capitalist Society</h1>
    <p>In his 'In the Flow' Boris Groys suggests that the supreme objective of humanity was always, from the very beginning of civilisation, the search of totality. Totality as universality, thereby a way out of particularity, the only possibility to stop being just a part and become a whole. To acquire immortality through overcoming finiteness state of secular, temporary being.</p>
    <p>This search was reflected in almost every religion, from primitive belief in spirits of water and fire, to Christianity with its promised afterlife that justified suffering in return of endless serenity in heaven.</p>
    <p>Yuval Noah Harari in 'A Brief History of Human Kind' states the evolution of civilisation may be described in three general steps. The first one is a dialogue between human and nature within primitive society of hunters-gatherers that depended completely on uncontrollable natural forces. The second emerged with agricultural revolution that lead to the emergence of nuclear families, personal property, patriarchic structure of community, and, most importantly, monotheistic notion of God. This era is characterised by the dialogue between human and God and the rise of Church as a transmitter. The transition to industrial society suddenly granted a human being the powers only gods possessed before, and one day, as Nietzsche proclaimed, the God was found dead. Here comes the third and the last step — humanity left alone in the immense universe, clinging to technology and machines.</p>
    <p>In XX century the never-ending pursuit of immortality for the first time stopped operating within the field of immaterial and transcendental. Instead, the machines were employed to continue this search.</p>
