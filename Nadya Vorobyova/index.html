    <h1> Progress Bar </h1>


  <p>Progress bar is one of the most interesting phenomena in design, because it was created solely to exist. No meaning, other than a clear indication of the waiting time as a percentage.
    Users want to have control over the system they use. This means that they need to understand the current context at any given time, especially when the system is working on a task.
    The progress indicator of the task is one of the most popular forms of providing system status for the user. The progress bar also carries a much greater burden on itself than it seems at first glance. At first, we don’t pay much attention to the identifier, we are just used to having it and our need for rational use of time is successfully fulfilling, but if you think about it a little deeper you understand that this is a complex psychological mechanism that goes into various areas of our life</p>
  <p>The progress bar is just an indicator on a computer that something's happening inside the device. Of course, in the modern world they came up with a variable design for the download indicator. Now there are two main types: definite and indefinite. The first one makes it clear to us in percentage terms how long the download will last, while the other simply visualizes the presence of the download process. No matter how good the design of the indicator is, its essence remains unchanged.The most important components remain: the loading panel and the indicator moving on it </p>
  <p< In my opinion, the progress bar metaphor is widely used everywhere. As I said before, the download indicator is widely used by creators of games and applications, not only to visualize the download, but also to show how much is left to go to the next level, which, in itself, is a reward. We also see the countdown at every step in the modern world. The traffic light shows how many seconds are left to stand, thereby relieving stress from the loss of time, the Moscow metro also made an indicator that marks stations that the train has already traveled, thereby indicating progress. . All these methods are widely aimed at relieving stress from expectations in various areas of life. </p>

<p>“Indicators can make people less anxious,” said Brad Myers in a 1985 publication. He was very involved in creating completely different loading indicators, then when he went back to graduate school to get his Ph.D., he actually studied progress bars and found that people really like them.Brad Mayers, who presented a paper on «percent-done progress indicators» at a conference on computer-human indicators in 1985, made a research in the process of which he established that the visualized loading process facilitates the irritation of waiting. It seems at first that  such a simple animation as a loading indicator answers the questions “what is happening” and “how long will it last». But in fact, the information that the progress bar gives us is absolutely useless. The psychological factor is important that the indicator is simply there.</p>
<p>After published his findings in 1985, and people drew attention. Pretty soon, progress bars began to appear everywhere, but there was one problem. Progress indicators give the user an accurate idea of ​​how many tasks were completed at any given time. So if the first ten percent load in ten seconds, then you think - well, it all takes 100 seconds. Except that it did not always take a hundred seconds. Sometimes the computer slowed down due to a slight increase in computing speed, and in the end you felt completely betrayed !! This revealed something really key in the psychology of expectation and why things often feel slower than they really are. It is all about our expectations.</p>
<p>Without expecting it ourselves, we are all users of progress bars because modern man cannot live without it. We are obsessed with time, namely its lack, so the question "How long will it take me?" does not lose its relevance, on the contrary, it is more and more penetrating into our lives, since it is an excellent example of positive reinforcement. Positive reinforcement is what happens simultaneously with the act and leads to an increase in the likelihood of this action in the future. That is why the progress bar turns into profitable social management.</p>
<p>The progress bar is an analogue of a baby's dummy in the adult world. And this is the very element that was created just to exist. The interest in this object is that everyone invents a meaning for himself. Surely you noticed how bored people begin to play with the progress bar, for example, move the mouse cursor in a circle to speed up the process. And if he really moves faster, we are captivated by excitement and a sense of joy. Also, the progress bar gives an idea of  the beginning and end, and these are questions that a person has been interested in for eternity. Also, the download indicator allows us to think that we really have control over time. For example, if half the indicator has loaded in 10 minutes, then we roughly imagine that we have 10 more minutes to leave for coffee or check mail So still, why is the progress bar gaining such popularity and becoming an integral part of any user interface?</p>
<p>Firstly, I found the answer through games and applications. "Things needs to be done!" This was the first reason that the indicator was created and became so in demand. Progress bar i a great game with peoples feelings -  our brain releases massive quantities of endorphins. Accomplished task carries with it encouragement, this is how it works in our head. In that case I can say that loading bar relates to a game. The relationship of the game is also traced on the example of creating dating applications. People are encouraged to fill out the profile with the help of the loading indicator. The relationship of the game is also traced on the example of creating dating applications. In them, people are encouraged to fill out a profile using the download indicator. The profile is full, the person receives pleasure, the creators of the application benefit.</p>
<p>The other example Another example of a company that often uses indicators is tour operators. Usually a site user has to wait a few minutes before a suitable tour will be picked up. The Kayak website acts as an interesting example, because it does not provide the user with a typical loading indicator, but rather shows in detail how the work of selecting a tour does. At this moment, a person does not feel boredom and annoyance from loading, on the contrary, new things are revealed to him, he becomes more enthusiastic and involved in the process</p>
<p>Actually, The success of the download indicator is directly related to the fact that this has a huge impact on human psychology. This element was created solely in order to clearly outline the boundary of time from beginning to end, and this is a kind of eternal questions of mankind. The progress bar also gives a sense of control and a sense of time, which is also important. I want to answer that the fact that the progress bar was created exclusively for the psychological comfort of users is of particular interest</p>
<p>Progress itself is the best reward for people. It keeps you sane transmitting euphoria. When we see the indicator moving forward, we are overwhelmed with a sense of delight, something happens, if we talk about the typical loading of a computer or file. And it works great. Because completion is useful in itself. Neuroscience confirms this. It turns out that when you perform a difficult task, your brain releases a huge amount of endorphins. With the magic of classical conditioning, you begin to associate current acts of completion and progress with the pleasure and satisfaction of your past impulses of endorphin caused by completion.  The charge indicator is similar to the well-known Tetris game in terms of its impact on human psychology. Tetris maintains our attention by constantly creating unfinished tasks. Each action in the game allows us to solve a part of the puzzle, for example, filling a row or rows so that they disappear. The chain of these partial solutions and constantly appearing unsolved problems can last for hours, each moment of which is filled with the same pleasures, similar to the feeling when you scratch a mosquito bite. </p>
<p>Trivial everyday tasks annoy us until we complete the task, satisfying the need to fulfill the goal. Tetris takes one more step and creates a continuous chain of frustrations and gratifications. Like a smart parasite, Tetris launches the instinctive pleasure of the mind - reaching a goal, and uses it against us. We can agree with this, enjoying the short-term thrills, playing a little, even though the wiser and more reflective part of us knows that the game is aimless. Like all good games, isn't it?</p>
<p>Also, games and applications, as well as the progress bar, work on the theory of positive reinforcement. Reinforcement - in the broad sense, any event, stimulus, action, reaction or information that, if followed by a reaction, serves to increase the relative frequency or likelihood of this reaction. This is just the idea that the completed task is encouragement. During a new level of the game, filling out the profile, at the moment when the pollution indicator reaches its maximum - we experience positive emotions, we feel that the matter is completed and we want to experience it again.</p>
<p>To conclude, I want to come back to my thought that since progress bar has only one value - exist. And by its existence to facilitate user expectation, it has practically no future. It’s hard to grow something completely new from this, except to update the design and add entertaining elements. In my opinion, the download indicator is currently at its peak - there are a sufficient number of types of this. Now the progress bar is turning into a separate art, as people try to diversify the visualization of the load as much as possible, but this does not change the original essence. But now I am more inclined to think that the progress bar is quite a multifaceted phenomenon in the psychology of design. It turns out that this is a very simple thing that human consciousness endowed with values ​​and it does not lose its value after many years. Moreover, I believe that the progress bar will not lose its popularity, since each device needs it, for the progress bar they will create an increasingly diverse design, because this chain is endless.In our information time, it is very difficult to catch the attention of a person, therefore, the creators of the progress bar resort to new ideas: the creation of simple and complex animations. The design can be simple or completely unpredictable, but so interesting that it can hold user attention until the application is fully loaded.</p>
