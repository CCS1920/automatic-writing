  <p>It is near impossible to explain the significance of language and list all of its uses since we are simply unable to comprehend the vast pool of purposes that it is utilized for by other people, a pool that is only expanding throughout the course of time. Literary experiments and linguistic research might have been something that was reserved for intellectuals and the higher ruling class in the past but is now something accessible to every single human being. Unfortunately, the structural and systematic approach that we are traditionally taught to perceive language with is, at times, unable to fully reflect all of the psychological and sociological needs we have in the process of our communication.</p>

  <p>It is for these reasons, that many people throughout history had sought to challenge the traditional notion and understanding of language because they could not be content with the thought that the current mode of communication is all there is and there is nothing that we could do to expand it. They realized, that their inner worlds, as well as the ever-changing outside world, are simply too complex to be translated into such a “primitive” structure as the conventional form of our text-based communication. These rapid industrial, and then technological changes that we as a society have experienced for the past 100 years have unmistakably left a strong imprint on the way we communicate with each other and use language. One of the most noteworthy of these changes was the introduction and consequent accessibility of images and video. In fact, if before we could only conduct our communication through the means of speech and writing, as pertains to traditional linguistics and language classifications, we had suddenly found ourselves in a different kind of situation, as our world became flooded with images.</p>

  <p>In order to examine this shift in communication it would be useful to take a look at the concrete poetry movement. It is perhaps the most straightforward representation of a persons desire to expand our way of communicating between each other by paying attention to and introducing elements that we had previously neglected. Concrete poets were not only interested in manipulating pre existing constructs of linguistic rules, but they were also intent on finding entirely new linguistic material. The strong ties that concrete poets had with artists at the time left a strong impact on the way they went about seeking this material. They explored the physicality and materiality of words, looking at separate letters and formations as nothing more than visual structures. Visual structures that could in turn, through the way that they look, give birth to new words and expressions, and the process of experimentation became an endless cycle. Concrete poets believed, that by freeing words from their stuffy preconceived constructs, they will be able to achieve a new method of self expression that is closest to what true human communication is. They were fixated on the idea of making the way we communicate more contemporary, by recognising the materiality in which we reside in our daily lives.They were intent on creating their own language, which would be, as they titled it, verbivocovisual and panlinguistic. Some of them, went as far as dismissing the semantic aspect of language whatsoever, focusing instead on transmitting an absolutely new kind of information. Their main goal was to create visuals that could transmit messages to everyone that saw them, regardless of the language they spoke or where they lived. </p>

  <p>It is then interesting to note, how an entire branch of poetry that boggled the minds of many, who were perhaps not ready to receive and understand the bogus propositions that the concrete poets were making, is completely mirrored in the results of the digital revolution. Something that was before reserved for writers, poets, and artists has become the mundane day-to-day of any person with access to electronic tools, television, and the media. While concrete poets were only left to imagine what it would be like to communicate through images and sounds, we do so every day by sending each other photographs that we quickly snapped with our phone.</p>
