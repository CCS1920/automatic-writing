  <!-- <h1>Automatic Writing </h1> -->
  <h2>Preamble</h2>
  <p>Writing is not the same as it was 20 or even 5 years ago. It evolves with technology. Tools we use for writing, research, and design drastically affect our work, our thinking, and the result.</p>
  <p>Most of our research happens online, among digital detritus and often takes the form of random notes, accidental screenshots, disorganized pdfs and broken links. These are the current conditions of knowledge production and accumulation that differ significantly from the conditions of a library. Writing happens among the state of constant flux as nothing on the web is ever finished (including your writing). That means: nothing is trustworthy enough, solid, well-rounded. Since it is never finished, it is always an iteration out of the series of iterations.</p>

  <h2>The core </h2>
  <p>For that brief I want you to treat writing in a bit abstract way. To look at it as </p>
  <ul>
      <li> the series of iterations/drafts/attempts </li>
      <li> as a never-finished process (and come to terms with that) </li>
      <li> as an attempt to remove all the unnecessary and focus on the structure of your writing </li>
  </ul>

<p>Programming has a lot of similarities with writing. First of all, it is an activity that operates with language and text. Second, you need to follow certain rules to achieve proper hierarchy in your text. Third, you want people to understand you (you follow certain conventions). We will be borrowing some concepts from programming such as version control and formatting systems to explore our writing process. We will use HTML tags and Git and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> to track down your writing progress and publish the results. You can also use code editor for actual writing (i.e. <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>).
