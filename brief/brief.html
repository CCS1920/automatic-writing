    <h1>Automatic Writing <h1>
    <h2>Preamble<h2>
      <p>Writing is not the same as it was 20 or even 5 years ago. It evolves with technology. Tools we use for writing, research, and design drastically affect our work, our thinking, and the result.<p>
      <p>Most of our research happens online, among digital detritus and often takes the form of random notes, accidental screenshots, disorganized pdfs and broken links. These are the current conditions of knowledge production and accumulation that differ significantly from the conditions of a library. Writing happens among the state of constant flux as nothing on the web is ever finished (including your writing). That means: nothing is trustworthy enough, solid, well-rounded. Since it is never finished, it is always an iteration out of the series of iterations.<p>
